# How I coded it
I started by learning how the file handling works in python and coded a basic file reader

After that I followed a tutorial where I learned how a basic file seacher works.

The problem was that in the video it shows you how you can make a searcher for databases that atleast has 3 colums
I wanted it to able to find any word from any file. 

So I started coding on my own and figured it out after 1-2 days.
