# How I coded it
I started by learning how the file handling works in python.
https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_handling.asp

After that I followed a tutorial where I learned how a basic file seacher works.

In the video, he shows you how you can make a word searcher for databases that atleast has 3 colums
I wanted to make a script that was able to find any word from any file. 

I than started coding on my own and made something work after 1-2 days with the code I had.
I also asked my learning partner for some help and advice

I later wanted to add a restart option to the code, and I followd this tutorial

As of the last day I wanted to add some variables and make the user able to choose from 2 options
I used my previous python knowledge from "telefonkatalog" and made 2 different selections 
that the user can choose from.
